        <h3>Eligibility:</h3>
        <p>ProNear, as permitted by applicable laws, obtains reports based on publicly available information regarding Pros, which may include history of criminal convictions or sex offender registration, and we may limit, block, suspend, deactivate, or cancel a Service Member’s account based on the results of such a check. As a Pro, you agree and authorize us to use your personal information, such as your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports from ProNear's vendors.
        </p>
        <h3>Scope of this service:</h3>
        <p>
        The ProNear Platform is a web-based communications platform which enables the connection between Users and Pros. “Users” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain Pro services (“Services”) from Pros and are therefore clients of Pros, and “Pros” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to provide Services for Users. Users and Pros together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.” If you agree on the terms of a Service with another User, you and such other User form a Service Agreement directly between the two of you as set forth in more detail in Section 3 below.<br>
        PRO’S ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT EMPLOYEES OF COMPANY. COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM SERVICES AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM SERVICES. USERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMPANY DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR A PRO’S WORK AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORK PERFORMED OR THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.<br>
        The ProNear Platform only enables connections between Users for the fulfillment of Services. Company is not responsible for the performance of Pros, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Services, Pros, Users, nor of the integrity, responsibility, qualifications or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users. Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Services requested and services provided by Users identified through the ProNear Platform whether in public, private, or offline interactions.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>User/Pros Vetting and User Representation and Warranties</h3>
        <p>
        User/Pro Vetting<br>
        In the Company’s sole discretion, Users & Pros may be subject to an extensive vetting process before they can register for and during their use of the ProNear Platform, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, at the Country, State and local level, using third party services as appropriate. Users hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with federal and state laws, including, without limitation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act.<br>
        Although Company may perform background checks of Users, as outlined above, Company is not required to do so and cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be and therefore, Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of identity or background check information or any information provided through the ProNear Platform.<br>
        When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE PRONEAR PLATFORM AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE PRONEAR PLATFORM.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Contract between Users and Pros</h3>
        <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that a contract (the “Service Agreement”) is formed when you agree on the terms of a Service with another User. The terms of the Service Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section, the engagement terms proposed and accepted on the ProNear Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Pro and the User to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this Agreement including this Section and do not expand Company’s obligations or restrict Company’s rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company (ProNear Inc.) is not a party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Company and the Pro.<br>
        Where approved in advance by the Client, the Pro is not obligated to personally perform the Services. Before any services are performed by any assistants, helpers, subcontractors or other personnel (collectively “Assistants”) engaged by the Pro, the Pro shall require any such individuals to become a registered Pro on the ProNear Platform pursuant to Company policies as described on the ProNear Platform. A Pro’s failure to bring an Assistant who is not a registered Pro could lead to removal from the platform. The Pro assumes full and sole responsibility for the payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses of Assistants, if any, and for all required and applicable state and federal income tax withholdings as to the Pro and all persons engaged by the Pro in the performance of the Service.<br>
        The Pro shall pay their assistant directly for completed Services through the PSP (as defined below) as indicated on the ProNear Platform at the rates agreed to by the parties in the Service Agreement. Each party agrees to comply with this Agreement during the engagement, performance and completion of a Service. Both parties agree to notify Company of any disputes prior to negotiation of or filing of any claims and to negotiate any dispute informally via Company representatives for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any proceeding between the parties.<br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1. Payments</b>
        <br><br>
        Users of the ProNear Platform contract for the Services directly with Pros. ProNear is not a party to any contracts for the Services. The ProNear Platform facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium through which Users can connect with Pros, schedule the Services, and make payments for the Services directly from the User to the Pro. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Users may not circumvent the ProNear Platform by using the ProNear Platform to connect with Providers and then engage those Providers for Services outside of the ProNear Platform.<br>
        <div style="padding-left:1.2em">
                    <ol>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	 <b>ProNear Guarantee</b><br>

        Our ProNear Guarantee is that the Service you order and pay for will be performed as described in the description of the Service when you ordered it. If you have ordered and paid for a Service but you believe the Service was not performed in accordance with the ProNear Guarantee you must report the issue within twenty-four (24) hours of the Service appointment to our Support Center at info@pronear.com and respond to all follow up questions requested of you from the Support Center and you may be eligible for the ProNear Guarantee Remedies. The " ProNear Guarantee Remedies" are as follows: if we determine that a Service does not meet the ProNear Guarantee we will, in our sole discretion, either refund the payment you actually made for such Service, or have the applicable Service re-performed. If the Service is re-performed but we determine the re-performance still does not meet the ProNear Guarantee, we will refund the payment actually made for such Service. The amount of the ProNear Guarantee is limited to any payment you made for the Service. The ProNear Guarantee does not apply to any other cost, liability, damage, injury, or claim arising from or in connection with the Services. To be clear, the ProNear Guarantee does not apply to any payments made for Services not scheduled and paid for through the ProNear Platform.

                3.	  Cancellation by Provider. As a Provider, you may cancel your scheduled Service appointments through the App. If you are more than 15 minutes late for a scheduled appointment (note: the scheduled time for a Now appointment is 1 hour from the time you are selected by your Customer) or fail to complete a scheduled Service, you shall be deemed to have cancelled such appointment. When you cancel a scheduled Service appointment, the ProNear Platform generally notifies your Customer to resubmit the request for Service. ProNear cannot guarantee that a cancelled Service appointment will be selected by another Provider and rescheduled or that the Service request will be completed. Thus, your cancellation or failure to timely show up to perform a scheduled appointment could negatively impact your Customer and the Platform. As a result, such conduct may adversely impact your rating among Customers. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT YOUR CANCELLATION OF (A) ANY “NOW” APPOINTMENTS, (B) ANY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS ON LESS THAN 24 HOURS NOTICE, OR (C) TWO OR MORE SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS WITHIN A 30-DAY PERIOD IS A VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE SUSPENSION OR DEACTIVATION YOUR PROVIDER ACCOUNT.

                <br><br>
                To help maintain the quality of the ProNear Platform, Users (both Providers and Customers) will have the opportunity to rate each other after the completion of Services.  If you rate your Provider or Customer with less than 3 stars, such User will be excluded from your future Service requests. Customers will see Provider ratings before selecting a Provider for a job so each rating a Customer gives can have an impact on that Provider's future on the ProNear Platform. In addition, Customers with a low star rating may not have their requests accepted.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Dispute Resolution – Arbitration</h3>
                <p>(a) Informal Negotiations.<br>
                To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim between you and Company (each a “Claim” and collectively “Claims”), you and Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Claim (except those Claims expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Company. Company’s address for such notices is ProNear Inc. 11301 W. Olympic Blvd. Ste 725, Los Angeles, CA Attention: Legal. If necessary to preserve a Claim under any applicable statute of limitations, you or Company may initiate arbitration while engaging in the informal negotiations.<br>
                (b) Binding Arbitration.<br>
                YOU AND COMPANY MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU (EXCEPT THOSE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED BELOW) IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.<br>
                This agreement to arbitrate, contained in Section 20, (“Arbitration Agreement”), is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives the termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Company. Claims include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy whether based on past, present or future events arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the ProNear Platform, services, Tasks, your relationship with Company, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User Account or this Agreement, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law, compensation, breaks and rests periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, emotional distress, any promotions, offers made by Company, breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Company and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including Claims about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.<br>
                YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WHICH BY TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.<br>
                (c) Agreement Prohibiting Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.<br>
                You and Company agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Company and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). Further, unless both you and Company otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Class Action Waiver shall not apply to Private Attorney General Act Claims brought against the Company which are addressed separately in Section 20 (d) below. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Dispute or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Dispute or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis.<br>
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, the class, collective, and/or representative action on such Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.<br>
                (d) Representative PAGA Waiver<br>
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, to the fullest extent allowed by law: (1) you and Company agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Company agree that any such Dispute will be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (that is, to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.<br>
                (e) Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration<br>
                The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding.<br>
                As part of the arbitration, both you and Company will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.<br>
                The arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Pro’s or Users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Pro or User to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act.<br>
                Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules) subject to the following modifications:<br>
                (i) If Company initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Company will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees. If a User or Pro, however, files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages does not exceed USD 10,000, Company will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); (ii) For Claims that (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between Company and the Pro; (B) arise out of, or relate to, the Company’s actual or threatened deactivation of a Pro’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to the Company’s actual or threatened termination of a Pro’s Agreement with the Company; or (D) arise out of, or relate to, monies earned or paid for Task services (as defined above, including the service chare or Trust and Support Fee), tips, bonuses or monies owed by Clients or Company to a Pro, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other Company sponsored promotions, or consumer-type disputes (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(D) shall be collectively referred to as “Pro Claims”), Company shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not paid by Company pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating the Pro Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Services to Clients, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection 20(e)(1) above. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. (iii) Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the Dispute(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.). (iv) At the conclusion of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.<br>
                Unless you and Company agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Company and a Pro will take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearings between Company and a Client will take place in the county in which you received Task services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration.<br>
                (f) Exceptions to Arbitration<br>
                The following types of Claims are not required to be arbitrated under the Arbitration Agreement:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Claims for workers’ compensation, disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;
                <li>Small claims actions that are within the scope of small claims court jurisdiction and brought on an individual basis;</li>
                <li>A representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorney general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section __ is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction;</li>
                <li>Claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of law.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. However you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint and instead may seek such relief only through arbitration under this Agreement. This Agreement and Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from participating in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision and do not prevent you from receiving an award for information provided to any government agencies.<br>
                (g) Severability.<br>
                In addition to the severability provisions in Section 20(d) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.<br>
                (h) Right to Opt Out of Arbitration Agreement<br>
                You may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by notifying Company in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the ProNear Platform or 30 days from the date this Agreement was last updated. To opt out, you must send a written notification to Company at ProNear Inc. 11301 W. Olympic Blvd. Ste 725, Los Angeles, CA 90064 Attention: Legal, that includes (a) your account username, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address, and (f) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provisions.<br>
                <b>21. Governing Law</b><br>
                Except as provided in Section 20 or expressly provided otherwise, this Agreement will be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles.
                </p>

                <p>

                If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
